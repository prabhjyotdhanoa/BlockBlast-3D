Was learning how to make a 3d game from sctrach using vertex buffers, writing .obj file parsers to create vertex buffers, how the GPU makes polygons, wtc...
Decided to add a little game element to the learning project.
The Goal? Clear an entire layer (either x-wise, y-wise, or z-wise)
Have fun! (Windows downloadable only for now lol)
